# RCOM-Vault  

Welcome to the **RCOM-Vault**, a repository containing our projects for the **Computer Networks (Redes de Computadores)** course. This repository features implementations and experiments focused on data communication and networking protocols, covering topics such as file transfer, network configuration, routing, NAT, DNS, and TCP analysis.  

## Projects  

### **Project 1 - Data Link Protocol**  
- **Description**: Developed an application for file transfer between two Linux machines using an **RS-232 serial cable**, implementing a reliable data link protocol.  

### **Project 2 - Network Configuration and FTP Client**  
- **Description**: Built a **file download application** using the **FTP protocol (RFC959)** and configured a computer network. The project included:  
  - Developing a **custom FTP client** to download files from a server.  
  - Setting up and experimenting with **network configurations** (IP addressing, routing, NAT, DNS, and TCP analysis).  
  - Using **Wireshark** to capture and analyze network traffic, troubleshooting communication issues.
